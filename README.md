# HACKERRANK // ALGORITHM ARCHIVE

<div align="center">
  <p>✦ <i>A systematic archive of algorithmic solutions engineered with C# and NUnit-driven verification.</i> ✦</p>

### // OVERVIEW
This repository serves as a technical record of my progress in algorithmic problem solving on the **HackerRank** platform. Unlike standard competitive programming repositories, this archive prioritizes **Software Engineering discipline** by implementing a decoupled architecture and automated verification layers.

The objective is to master the transition from raw logic to testable, modular, and maintainable C# code.

### // SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The solution is decoupled into three primary layers to ensure a professional development workflow and clear separation of concerns:

* **`ProblemSolving/`** | The core library containing the algorithmic implementations and primary logic units.
* **`UnitTesting/`** | A rigorous testing suite using **NUnit** to validate the `ProblemSolving` modules against platform-specific edge cases.
* **`CallerApp/`** | The entry-point application used to execute and visualize solutions within a real-time terminal environment.

### // TECH STACK
* **Language** | C# (.NET Core)
* **Testing Framework** | NUnit Framework
* **Architecture** | Decoupled Library System
* **Philosophy** | Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles

### // CORE PHILOSOPHY
This project prioritizes **Functional Integrity**. While the immediate goal is to pass HackerRank’s assessment criteria, the underlying mission is to maintain high-integrity code standards. By implementing **NUnit** for competitive programming, I ensure that every solution is not only correct but verified through a repeatable, automated process.
